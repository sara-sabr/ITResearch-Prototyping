## The Question

If there were no budget, staffing, or other constraints, what would the business look like? How will it drive value and provide meaningful work?  
[Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/technology-and-the-future-of-work/tech-leaders-reimagining-work-workforce-workplace.html?id=us:2el:3lk:4di_gl:5eng:6di&range=4/207/3/1/3/43/84/0:1,4/207/3/1/3/43/84/0:145)

### The Value add?

- Outcomes/Results over tooling
- Accelerate onboarding through flexibility of tools
- Moving the organization towards potientially examining BYOD
- Driving crowd source collaboration

--

### Continuing Improvements

Let's experiment what we support to drive results quicker. Technology constantly improves, so let's see how we can adopt them.

## The Risks and Mitigations

How do we ensure we don't impact our security posture while we try out new ideas.

--

### Desktop Management

**Risk**: Management of multiple different OSes

**Mitigation**: Research device management tools to support Windows, Linux and Mac. Cloud based solutions like [Microsoft Intune](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise-mobility-security/microsoft-intune). Ensure patches are applied whether the device is on/off the corporate network.

--

### Asset Management

**Risk**: Ensuring assets are tracked and one asset per user

**Mitigation**: Research approaches of one asset per user while retaining access to corporate applications.
- Virtual machine to access corporate apps?
- Virtual Kiosk for users
- Web portal applications

--

### Security Posture

**Risk**: Connecting devices that are not enterprise ready is a risk.

**Mitigation**: Devices will remain off network during this research phase.
- Virtual machine or Kiosk will be used to access network when required

--

## Approaches

Research through experimentation for each OS and produce findings on their experience
- 1 control group
- 1 super user group
- 1 regular user group
