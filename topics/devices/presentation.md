## Agenda

1. The Ask
2. The Why
3. The How
4. Summary
5. Questions

---

## The Ask

The approval to experiment with multiple OSes and software that focus on ensuring ESDC remains innovative and continuing to attract talent.

---

## The Why

If there were no budget, staffing, or other constraints, what would the business look like? How will it drive value and provide meaningful work?

### The Value add?

- Outcomes and results over standard tooling
- Accelerate onboarding through flexibility and leveraging pre-existing experience
- Ensuring solutions remain open to other departments and citizens
- Moving the organization towards **B**ring/**C**hoose **Y**our **O**wn **D**evice 
- Adopting open source software as per [Directive on Management of Information Technology - C.2.3.8](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15249#claC.2.3.8)
- Technology that is at least as good as people have at home - [UK](https://cabinetofficetechnology.blog.gov.uk/2015/02/12/choosing-technology-that-is-at-least-as-good-as-people-have-at-home/)

### The statistics

Let's look at some stats on why entertain this.

--

#### Worldwide OS

[Reference - StatsCounter](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet/worldwide/#monthly-201807-201907)

--

#### The Linux Explosion

Since Linux is so low usage, why even suggest Linux?

It's used in the server environment, we should be matching what we develop on.

- [Linux Runs on All Top 500 Supercomputers](https://itsfoss.com/linux-runs-top-supercomputers/)
- [Linux dominates Azure](https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-now-dominates-azure/)

--

#### The Mac

- Development of native mobile applications for iPhones
- Availability of [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) for creative software

--

#### Internet Browsers

#### IT Developers

![Most Loved Environment](https://github.com/sara-sabr/ITResearch-Prototyping/raw/master/topics/devices/assets/2019-stackoverflow-dev.png)  
[Stackoverflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019/#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-platforms)

---

## The How

1. Research through experimentation for each OS and produce findings on their experience
   - 1 control group
   - 1 super user group
   - 1 regular user group
2. Three devices for each OS type (Linux and Mac)
3. Devices will remain off network until they are secured and proof of concept advances to operationalization
4. Status updates and constant consultations with stakeholders 
5. Review at end of the year on how it went.

--

### Learn lessons from others

- Department with Linux desktops
   - Consult with [Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada](https://gcconnex.gc.ca/file/download/24621373) 
   - Consult with Environment Canada
- Departments with CYOD and tooling
   - [CDS](https://digital.canada.ca/2018/06/27/tools-to-do-good-work/)
   - [UK](https://cabinetofficetechnology.blog.gov.uk/2015/02/12/choosing-technology-that-is-at-least-as-good-as-people-have-at-home/)

---

## The Concerns

How do we ensure we don't impact our security posture while we try out new ideas.

--

### Desktop Management

**Risk**: Management of multiple different OSes

**Mitigation**: 

1. Research device management tools to support Windows, Linux and Mac. 
    - Cloud based solutions like [Microsoft Intune](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise-mobility-security/microsoft-intune).     
2. Ensure patches are applied whether the device is on/off the corporate network.
3. Automate patches for software selected.

--

### Asset Management

**Risk**: Ensuring assets are tracked and one asset per user

**Mitigation**: Research approaches of one asset per user while retaining access to corporate applications.
- Virtual machine to access corporate apps?
- Virtual Kiosk for users
- Web portal applications

--

### Security Posture

**Risk**: Connecting devices that are not enterprise ready is a risk.

**Mitigation**:
- Devices will remain off network during this research phase.
    - LIAS will be leveraged to have monitoring 
- Virtual machine or Kiosk will be used to access network when required
- Research cloud based virtual desktops for ESDC network access

---

## The Summary

We are seeking approval for a proof of concept on supporting multiple different OSes and how it would look for an ESDC user.
